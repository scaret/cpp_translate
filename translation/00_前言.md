# 前  言

*Computing Fundamentals with C++, 3rd Edition*是一部用C++编程语言为计算机系学生讲解首门课程的教材，它的主要适用人群是没有任何编程经验，以及有使用其他编程语言经验的学生。

*Computing Fundamentals with C++, 3rd Edition*致力于利用面向对象编程的相关性和有效性来介绍计算基础概念。这本书中汇聚了我们数十年来的教学经验，它知道如何才能最大限度地帮助学生学习他们在计算机系上的首门课程，如何将对象与类的关系解释得最恰到好处，以及如何为学生的下一门课程打下最坚实的基础。

## 本书特色

**图书资源齐全：** 我们将本书中大部分的C++代码，以及以演示文稿格式写成的章节大纲都上传到了网上，读者可以自行从```https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/people/mercer/compfun3/```处下载到自己想要的资源。

**涵盖传统主题：** 本书致力于利用面向对象编程的相关性和有效性来介绍计算基础概念。在这过程中，我们也会涉及到一些C++的特性，它们也会被我们归为传统主题的一部分，譬如在前两节课中，我们就会涉及到泛型类的模版、带迭代器的标准容器。

**基于标准C++：** 由于国际标准化组织（International Standards Organization，简称ISO）在多年前就已经批准了C++的标准文档，所以学生们现在可以将自己所学习的C++视为一门具有国际公认标准的编程语言了。当然，直到笔者撰写本文的这一刻，C++14标准也依然没有得到所有编译器的完全支持。正因为考虑到这一点，并且C++14标准实际上所添加的内容也超出了本书要讨论的范围，我们打算在这本书中只使用C++11中的元素。不过读者也不用太担心，由于任何较新的版本基本上都是向后兼容的，所以我们当然也可以使用支持C++14的或者更新版本的编译器来编译本书的代码。

**Gentle Objects-Early Approach.** This third edition maintains the objects-early approach of the fi rst and second editions. Students begin by using existing objects such as string, cin, cout, BankAccount, and Grid for Karel-like (Rich Pattis) programming while honing problem-solving and program-development skills. Students will then modify, enhance, and ultimately design and implement their own classes of increasing complexity.

**Carefully Chosen Subset of Analysis, Design, and C++.** Because students using this textbook might have little or no programming or design experience, several C++ features and subtleties are not presented. Students concentrate on a solid subset of this feature-rich language. Some trickier topics are delayed until the later chapters. For example, nested loops with vectors of vectors, pointers, dynamic memory management, and the singly linked data structure are in the final two chapters. Advanced topics such as copy constructors, destructors, and operator overloading have been removed from this third edition.

**Not Tied to a Specifi c System.** Th ere is no bias toward a particular operating system or compiler. Th is textbook presents standard \#includes and namespaces according to the ISO standard. All material applies to any computer system using standard C++. All code has been tested with Microsoft Visual C++ on Windows, and GNU g++ on Unix.

**Algorithmic Patterns.** Algorithmic patterns help beginning  programmers design algorithms around a set of common algorithm generalities. Th e fi rst algorithmic pattern, and perhaps one of the oldest—Input/Process/Output (IPO)—is introduced in Chapter 1. It is reused in subsequent chapters. Th e IPO pattern is especially useful to students with no programming experience and to the lab assistants helping them. Other algorithmic patterns introduced in the appropriate places include Alternative Action and Indeterminate Loop.

**Extensively Tested in the Classroom and Lab.** This textbook was six years in the making. Students supplied many useful comments and suggestions concerning manuscript clarity, organization, projects, and examples. Th e tremendous personal contact and testability was made possible with closed lab sections for all students.

## PEDAGOGY

This textbook has many pedagogical features that make this introduction to programming, design, and object technology accessible to students.

**Self-Check Questions.** Th ese short questions and answers allow students to evaluate whether they understand the details and terms presented in the reading. Th e answers to all self-check questions are included at the end of this textbook.

**Exercises.** Th ese transitional problems examine the major concepts presented in the chapter. Answers are available only to instructors to encourage students to write down the answers with paper and pencil, as if they were practice test questions.

**Programming Tips.** Each set of weekly programming projects is  preceded by a set of programming tips intended to help students complete programs while warning of potential pitfalls, and promoting good programming habits.

**Programming Projects.** Many relatively small-scale problems have been extensively lab tested to ensure that projects can be assigned and completed with little or no instructor intervention. The programming projects are strategically positioned to occur every week of lecture to reinforce the concepts just presented.

## WHAT’S NEW IN THIS THIRD EDITION?

This third edition contains dramatic improvements in programming projects, making them more interesting and challenging. Included are projects I have developed and class-tested at the University of Arizona,and, in fact, students have rated these “outside” assignments very highly. Th is third edition is smaller. We removed chapters on inheritance, object-oriented programming and design, operator overloading, and recursion. Adopters weren’t using these chapters and  we felt the second edition was too big at 830 pages. The topics in  this edition refl ect everything used in a traditional CS1 course while adding a few topics from CS2, such as generic collections with templates.

This third edition has been updated to make sure everything works using the current standard, C++14. Th is edition also incorporates a few appropriate additions to C++, such as the longoverdue literal nullptr. Most of the major additions to the C++ programming language, such as threads, are beyond the scope of this textbook.

## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Critical feedback from students and other instructors is essential to creating a solid textbook. For the fi rst and second editions, I was fortunate enough to have small lecture sizes (20 to 35 students) and to be in all labs with all of my students for 10 years. Th is enabled me to keep track of their progress and of their problems, which has dramatically helped produce a textbook that is accessible to the intended audience. I acknowledge and thank those Penn State students.

I have been fortunate to encounter many excellent educators and industry people who care and think about the same issues. Th e debates and new ideas generated in discussions, both live and by email, have allowed me to make the plethora of informed decisions necessary for producing a high-quality textbook. I wish to acknowledge the following people (listed in reverse alphabetical order) with apologies to those whom I have unintentionally left out: Gene Wallingford, Doug Van Weiren, David Teague, Marty Stepp, Dave Richards, Stuart Reges, Margaret Reek,Ken Reek, Rich Pattis, Allison Obourn, Linda Northrop, Zung Nguyen, John McCormick, Carolina McCluskey, Lester McCann, Mary Lynn Manns, Mike Lutz, David Levine, Patrick Homer, Jim Heliotis, Peter Grogono, Adele Goldberg, Michael Feldman, Ed Epp, Robert Duvall (the lecturer from Duke, not the actor), Ward Cunningham, Alistair Cockburn, Mike Clancy, Tim Budd, Barbara Boucher-Owens, Mike Berman, Joe Bergin, Owen Astrachan, and Erzebet Angster.

Though too numerous to mention, I also acknowledge the many authors and presenters who have infl uenced me during my thirty-year career. In addition, my thanks go to the people at Franklin, Beedle & Associates: the late Jim Leisy, Jaron Ayres, Brenda Jones, and Tom Sumner.

## REVIEWERS

Reviewers spend many hours poring over material with critical eyes and useful comments. Because of the high quality of their work, criticisms and recommendations were always considered seriously. I thank the reviewers of this and previous editions.

## SPECIAL THANKS

I would like to thank super-reviewer Kristin Roberts from Grand Rapids Community College. Not only did she provide tremendous feedback, Kristin encouraged me to complete this third edition. Th ere have been several major changes, some reorganization of chapters, many refinements, some updates, and many new programming projects. This textbook is now current, in large part because of Kristin.
