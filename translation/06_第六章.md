## 第六章 类的定义与成员函数

### 前章回顾
Functions hide details, can be called many times, can be reused in other programs, and help in the design of larger programs. Each function performs a well-defined service.

函数隐藏了实现细节，并且可以调用很多次，也可以在其他的程序中重用，这在大型程序设计中非常有用。每个函数都实现了一个定义良好的服务。

### 本章提要

When a function belongs to a class, it becomes a class member function. Class member functions have a lot in common with their nonmember cousins. Chapter 6 presents an introduction to C++ class de nition and member function implementations. You will learn to read and understand classes by their de nitions—the collection of member function headings (the interface) and data members (the state). In the second part of this chapter, you will learn to implement class member functions. You will also see a few appropriate object-oriented design guidelines that help explain why classes are designed the way they are. After studying this chapter, you will be able to

+ read and understand class definitions (interface and state) 
+ implement class member functions using existing class defnitions 
+ apply some object-oriented design guidelines

当一个函数属于一个类时，它就成了这个类成员函数。类成员函数与非成员函数之间有很多共同之处。 第6章介绍了C++类定义和成员函数实现。您将学习通过其 ___定义___（成员函数头文件定义（接口）和数据成员（状态）的集合）来阅读和理解类。在本章的第二部分中，您将学习如何实现类成员函数。 您还将看到一些适当的面向对象设计指南，这些指南有助于解释为什么那些类要设计成那个样子。学完本章后，您将能够：

+ 阅读和理解类定义（接口和状态）

+ 使用现有的类定义实现类成员函数

+ 运用一些面向对象的设计指南

#### 6.1 在头文件中定义类

Abstraction refers to the practice of using and understanding something without full knowledge of its implementation. Abstraction allows the programmer using a class to concentrate on the data characteristics and the messages that manipulate the state. For example, a programmer using the string class need not know the details of the internal data representation or how those opera- tions are implemented in the hardware and software.  e programmer can concentrate on the set of allowable messages—the interface.

This chapter presents some implementation issues that so far have been hidden. In the  rst part of this chapter, the BankAccount class will be studied at the implementation-detail level. However, before examining the physical side of class design, let’s consider some of the design decisions that were made for this textbook’s BankAccount class.

抽象是指在不完全了解其实现的情况下使用和理解某些东西的做法。抽象允许程序员集中于数据的特征和操纵状态的消息。例如，使用字符串类的程序员既不需要知道内部数据表示的细节，也不需要知道如何在硬件和软件中实现这些操作。 程序员可以专注于允许的消息集-- ___接口___。

本章介绍了迄今为止隐藏的一些实现问题。在本章的第一部分，我们会在实现细节层面进行研究`BankAccount`类。但是，在我们深入了解其实现细节之前，让我们考虑一下为本书的`BankAccount`类做出的一些设计上的决定。

All BankAccount objects have four allowable operations: deposit, withdraw, getBalance, and getName.  ere could have been more, or there could have been fewer.  e member functions for BankAccount were chosen to keep the class simple and to provide a collection of operations that are relatively easy to relate to. A compromise was made.  e design decisions were in uenced by the context—a  rst example of a C++ class used in a particular domain, the area of banking. e BankAccount member functions that make up the interface are only a subset of the operations named by students who were asked this question: what should we be able to do with bank accounts?  e data members are also a subset of the operations named by students who were asked this question: what should bank accounts know about themselves?
 
所有`BankAccount`的对象都允许四个操作：`deposit`，`withdraw`，`getBalance`和`getName`。我们当然也可以定义更多，或者更少的成员函数，但是我们在此遵从一个原则：应该保持`BankAccount`类的简洁，并且操作也应该是容易且相关的。于是我们在此做了妥协。设计决策也受到场景的影响——我们在定义特定领域（银行领域）中使用的C++类的第一个例子。
  
`BankAccount`的这四个成员函数是为了解决这个问题：我们应该如何处理银行账户？而数据成员则解决了这个问题：银行账户应该了解自己的哪些内容？

Many additional operations that were recognized by students (transfer, applyInterest, printMonthlyStatement) and many additional data members (type of account, record of trans- actions, address, Social Security number, and mother’s maiden name) were not included.  e design of these classes was a ected by the intention of keeping these objects as simple as pos- sible while retaining some realism. However, a group of object-oriented designers developing large-scale applications in the banking domain would likely retain many of the operations and attributes recognized by students.  ere is rarely one single design that is correct for all circum- stances.

学生们认可的许多其他操作（`transfer`，`applyInterest`，`printMonthlyStatement`）和许多其他数据成员（帐户类型，交易记录，地址，社会安全号码和母亲的婚前姓名）均未包括在内。在这里，类的设计是为了保持对象尽可能简单，同时保留一些实用性。相反地，在现实的银行领域的大规模应用程序中，很多面向对象的设计人员开发很可能会保留这些学生认可的许多操作和属性。很少有一种设计适合所有环境。

Designing anything requires making decisions in an e ort to make the thing “good.” Good might mean having a software component that is easily maintainable; it might mean classes that can be reused in other applications; or it might mean a system that is very robust—one that can recover from almost any disastrous event. Good might mean a design that results in something that is easier to use, prettier, etc.  ere is rarely ever a single perfect design.  ere are usually trade-o s. Design is an iterative process that evolves with time.

设计任何东西都需要做出决定以使事情变得“好”。“好”可能指拥有一个易于维护的软件组件;“好”也可能指可以在其他应用程序中重用的类; 或者“好”可能指一个非常强大的系统——强大到可以从几乎任何灾难性事件中恢复。“好”可能指一个更容易使用，更漂亮的设计。很少有一个完美的设计。通常它只是一种平衡。而设计是一个随时间演变的迭代过程。

Design is in uenced by personal opinion, evolving research, and the domain, which could be banking, information systems, process control, engineering, and so on. Fortunately, there are design guidelines to show the way, a few of which are presented later. Let’s now turn to the con- struct that captures many of these design decisions in object-oriented software development—the class de nition.

设计受个人意见，不断发展的研究和领域的影响。可能是银行，信息系统，过程控制，工程等。幸运的是，有一些设计指南可以总结出设计模式，其中一些将在后面介绍。现在，让我们转向在面向对象的软件开发中捕获许多这些设计决策的结构—— __类的定义__。

 e classes of objects under study—ostream, istream, string, BankAccount, and Grid—are building blocks of larger programs. However, programs typically require many other classes.  ey may be standard classes, classes that are bought o  the shelf, or other classes that must be de- signed and implemented by a programming team.Because it is di cult to have mastery of all classes in a large project, this section provides some general techniques for understanding unfamiliar classes.  e knowledge attained here also provides experience with the major component of object-oriented software development—the class.

我们所学习过的对象的类，通常是大型程序的基石，例如`study-ostream`，`istream`，`string`，`BankAccount`和`Grid`。但是，程序通常需要许多其他类。它们可能是标准类，常用的类，或者其他必须由编程团队设计和实现的类。
因为很难掌握大型项目中的所有类，所以本节提供了一些理解不熟悉的类的一般技巧。另外，我们还提供一些面向对象软件开发的重要经验。
