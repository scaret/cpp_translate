CHAPTER SUMMARY

-   An ifstream object may be associated with a disk fi le so large that
    > amounts of data may be input quickly—with no human intervention.

-   Th e ! operator is overloaded to determine if a fi le has not been
    > properly opened for input.

-   Use the input operator &gt;&gt; in the loop test to read input until
    > the end of any fi le of any size.

-   You can use ofstream objects like cout. Th e only diff erence is
    > that the output goes to a disk fi le rather than the
    > computer screen.

2.  Be careful when using getline and &gt;&gt; together. Be careful when
    > mixing getline with the &gt;&gt; operator on the same
    > input stream. Th e &gt;&gt; operator skips whitespace; getline
    > does not. Worse yet, cin &gt;&gt; will stop at the new line. A
    > subsequent getline will go up to the new line, eff ectively
    > reading nothing. In this case, you will need an extra getline to
    > get beyond the end of the line.

3.  Use test drivers for reading complex data. Seemingly bizarre things
    > can occur when you try to input complex data in an end-of-fi
    > le loop. Consider fi rst writing a test driver with code that
    > inputs the fi rst line from the fi le and then displays it.

4.  Input is messy. Using istream &gt;&gt; and getline on the same input
    > stream can cause diffi cultto-detect errors. Additionally, when
    > there is a mix of integer, fl oating-point, character, and string
    > input, it is not always easy to get the input statements correct.
    > Th e number of objects in an input statement must always
    > be correct. Th e input fi le must always be correct.

9A WIND SPEEDS ON FILE

> Write a program that determines the lowest, highest, and average of a
> set of wind speed readings from a fi le. Th e number of readings is
> not known in advance. First create a fi le in your working
>
> (current) directory as wind.data and use the ifstream constructor to
> open the fi le for input as follows:
>
> ifstream inFile("wind.data");

Programming Projects

> Th e program should work for all fi les containing only ints so any
> number of inputs should produce correct results. Run your program with
> the following fi le named wind.dat. Verify that the output is correct
> by producing results by hand and comparing your output.

9B WORDS IN A FILE

> Write a C++ program that approximates the number of words in a fi le
> that has the fi le name input by the user. Remember to use
> string::c\_str to initialize the ifstream object.
>
> cin &gt;&gt; leName;
>
> ifstream inFile( leName.c\_str());

9C PAYROLL REPORT (PREREQUISITE 7D: CLASS EMPLOYEE)

> In this project you are asked to use your Employee class as the basis
> for a payroll program that processes many employees. Th e input data
> to be processed are stored in an external fi le with the following
> format:
>
> Sam Barker 40.0 15.00 2 S
>
> Casey Baker 42.0 12.00 3 M
>
> Joey Cook 30.5 9.99 1 S
>
> Chris Glazer 40.0 11.57 1 M
>
> Create a report in a new fi le named payroll.report that looks like
> the following (with ? replaced by the correct answers, of course).
> Also show all totals for every category except the pay rate (*Note:*
> Income tax is based in the 2015 Employer Tax Guide; this changes
> yearly).
>
> Output fi le named payroll.report
>
> Pay Hours Gross Income SocSec Medi Net Employee
>
> Rate Worked Pay Tax Tax care Pay Name
